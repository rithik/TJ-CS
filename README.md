# TJHSST CS

I am Rithik Yelisetty, Thomas Jefferson High School Science and Technology Class of 2018. 

This repository contains all of my Computer Science labs that I completed while I was at TJ, including:
- Accelerated CS
- AP Computer Science
- Artificial Intelligence 1 
- Artificial Intelligence 2
- Mobile App Development
- Web App Development
- Parallel Computing 1
- Parallel Computing 2
- Computer Vision 1
- Computer Vision 2

I have decided to make all of my work private since many of the labs are still used in these classes at TJ. If you would like me to share my repository with you, please email me at rithik@gmail.com.
