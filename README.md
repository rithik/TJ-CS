# TJHSST CS

I am Rithik Yelisetty, Thomas Jefferson High School Science and Technology Class of 2018. 

This repository contains all of my Computer Science labs that I completed while I was at TJ, including:
- Accelerated CS
- AP Computer Science
- Artificial Intelligence 1 
- Artificial Intelligence 2
- Mobile App Development
- Web App Development
- Parallel Computing 1
- Parallel Computing 2
- Computer Vision 1
- Computer Vision 2

I have decided to make all of my work private since many of the labs are still used in these classes at TJ.
